Problem Statement: K-Means Clustering on the Iris Dataset
Objective:
The goal is to implement the K-Means Clustering Algorithm to categorize flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their measurements. The dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. By applying K-Means clustering, we aim to group the data into three clusters that correspond to the three species.

Problem Description:
Given the Iris dataset with the following columns:

sepal.length: The length of the sepal of the flower.
sepal.width: The width of the sepal.
petal.length: The length of the petal.
petal.width: The width of the petal.
variety: The species of the flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica).
We will:

Apply K-Means clustering on the dataset using 3 clusters (since there are three species).
Visualize the clustering results by plotting the data points and centroids.
Compare the clustering result with the actual labels (species) to evaluate performance.
Algorithm Steps:
Step 1: Input Data

The input is a dataset of flower measurements with features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with the flower species.
Step 2: Choose the Number of Clusters (K)

Set K = 3 since we know there are three species in the dataset.
Step 3: Initialize Centroids

Randomly initialize three centroids in the 4-dimensional feature space (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
Step 4: Cluster Assignment

For each data point, compute the Euclidean distance to all three centroids and assign the data point to the nearest centroid.
Step 5: Update Centroids

Recalculate the centroids as the mean of all the data points assigned to each cluster.
Step 6: Repeat

Continue steps 4 and 5 until the centroids converge (i.e., they do not change significantly between iterations).
Step 7: Output

The final cluster labels and centroids are returned after the algorithm has converged.
Step 8: Visualization

Plot the clusters based on the first two features (sepal length and sepal width) and mark the centroids.
